ElevatedButton â€“ Three Key Attributes

This demo highlights three important properties of the ElevatedButton widget:

onPressed

Defines the action when the button is tapped.

In this demo, it updates the UI to display the entered account number and balance.

child

Specifies the widget inside the button (usually text or an icon).

Here, itâ€™s a Text("Paste") widget.

style (optional, customizable)

Allows you to change the appearance (colors, size, shape, etc.).

Example: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(backgroundColor: Colors.blue) would give a custom button color.
